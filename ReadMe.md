Summary: In this project we try predict if a patient has diabetes or not depending on different health parameters using logistic regression.

# Part 0 - Info on Dataset

The dataset consists of the following parameters.
Pregnancies,
Glucose,
BloodPressure,
SkinThickness,
Insulin,
BMI,
DiabetesPedigreeFunction,
Age

**Using these features we pridict the outcome if diabetes is there or not.**

# Part 1 - Visualizations

Some key visualizations include

- **The countplot shows that 2/3 of people in our dataset does not have diabetes.**

- **The displot shows that disbetis is more common in young age group and less common for older people.**
The skewness was 1.12 and krutosis of 0.6

- **Seeing the change of diabetes with no of pregnancy**

- **Histogram plot of Diabetic patient wrt age**
minimun age with diabetes = 21
q1 = 24
median = 29
q3 = 41
maximun age with diabetes = 66 with few outliers(6) of more than 66

- **Heatmap of correlation**
We see that age and Glucose has higher correlation(0.5) for diabetes followed by BMI (0.3)

- **Histplot of all features**
Glucose , blood pressure and BMI have a normal distribution
Age , insulin and DiabetesPedigreeFunction are skewed

- **Box Plot of Age vs BMI** â†’ shows the variation of BMI for age

- **KDE plot of Outcome (Diabetic) wrt numerical features**
The numeric features are â†’ 'Pregnancies','Glucose','BloodPressure','SkinThickness','Insulin', 'BMI','DiabetesPedigreeFunction','Age'
